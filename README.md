# Introduction

This project uses the directory structure suggested by [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) using the
`typescript` template, along with some preferential modifications, such as:

* Removal of `@testing-library/react` and related dependencies for testing components.
* Inclusion of an [example `.env` file](./.env.example) as well as its integration on the [main HTML
  file](./public/index.html) and the [entry code](./src/index.tsx)
* Separation of ESLint and Browserslist configurations from the [`package.json` file](./package.json) through the
  [`.eslintrc`](./.eslintrc) and [`.browserslistrc`](./.browserslistrc) files respectively.
* Separation of style sheets from the [entry code](./src/index.tsx) and the [`App` component](./src/App.tsx) through the
  [`index.css` file](./public/index.css). The project should use a CSS-in-JS solution such as
  [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com) which will be demonstrated in the next commits.
* Addition of [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) and [`.prettierrc`](./.prettierrc)
* Removal of sample tests and configuration.

In order to navigate the code through the history, enter the following commands:

    $ git config --global alias.next '!git checkout `git rev-list HEAD..demo-end | tail -1`'
    $ git config --global alias.prev 'checkout HEAD^'

The code adds `next` and `prev` respectively so commands such as `git next` and `git prev` could be used.
